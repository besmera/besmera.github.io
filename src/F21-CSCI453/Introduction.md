# Introduction

## Types of HCI Contributions

* ***Empirical***
    * Qualitative
    * Quantitative
    * Surveys, Focus Groups, Time Diaries, Sensors, Instrumentation, Ethnography, etc...
* ***Artifact***
    * Often accompanied by empirical

## Types of HCI Contributions

* Methodological
    * New approach or process to carry out research
    * Instrument for measurement
* Theoretical
    * Predictive or descriptive concepts/models
* Dataset
    * Data 
* Opinion
    * Persuade readers

## Research

* Research generally needs to be 
    * Relevant/rigorous
    * Influence 
        * Interface design
        * Development processes
        * User training
        * Public policy 
    * Traditionally focuses on practical results that improve quality of life

## Measurement

* Early measurement based on human performance
	* Completion Time
	* Success Rate/Error Rate
	* Time to Learn
	* Retention Over Time
	* Satisfaction
* Typically *Task Based* Study
	* Separated -  Discrete/make sense
	* Quantified/Measured 

## Micro/Macro HCI

* Micro-HCI
    * Task Performance
* Macro-HCI
	* User Motivation, Collaboration, Trust, etc...
	* Societal Impact
* Consider something enjoyable like a video game

## Experimental

* Experimental Model 
	* Hypothesis testing with statistics
	* Good for how often, long, successful, etc...
	* Not always suited to why
	* Well understood
* Other Models
	* Ethnography
	* Focus Group
	* Interview, etc...

## Early Research

* Researching a new topic?
* Consider exploratory research using:
    * Surveys
    * Interviews
    * Ethnography 
    * etc...

## Types of Research

* Certain domains may lend different types of research
* Consider mobile "in the wild" vs laboratory
	* Weather
	* Distractions
* Issues to consider such as consent to data collection

## Data Collection and Replication

* No such thing as perfect data collection
* Rarely is one study or finding the definitive answer
* Replication is important
	* Studies should include sufficient details for replication
	* Results in "triangulation"

## Replication

* Even better when verified using different research methods
	* Multiple studies 
        * Broad shallow navs are better than narrow deep
* Findings can change over time
	* Frustrations of early web users vs today

## Design Nuance 

* Design is not simple and not an optimization problem
* Different stakeholders can be... different
* Understand conflicts/tradeoffs between groups
* Even if something is better, may not be adopted
	* Keyboard
* Sometimes people desire it... iPhone
